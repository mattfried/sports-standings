Sports Standings website

http://www.sportstandings.ca/


## About:
Sports standings website with real-time data for the most popular leagues.


## Approach:
This website is powered by Keystone.js (Node.js CMS) platform, built on Express and MongoDB.
It utilizes [MySportsFeeds](https://www.mysportsfeeds.com/) data API, and incorporates my self-modified version of their [NodeJS wrapper](https://github.com/mattfried/mysportsfeeds-node) in "data.js".
Socket.io is used to seamlessly communicate between the client and server.


## General guide to implement this repo into your own application:

Coming soon.... for now, please refer to [sports-standings-demo](https://github.com/mattfried/sports-standings-demo) for insight on standings page without Keystone.js integration.
